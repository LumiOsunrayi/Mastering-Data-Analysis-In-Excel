# Mastering-Data-Analysis-In-Excel
During my Master of Business Analytics degree program, I took Spreadsheet Modeling and Financial Modeling classes that covered manipulating data using Microsoft Excel above the intermediate level. However, to hone my skills, be better prepared for the job market and perhaps learn something new, I decided to take an Udemy course - Mastering Data Analysis in Excel by Vardges Zardaryan.

The course uses a delivery company dataset that has 18,480 customers and 67,375 order records.
