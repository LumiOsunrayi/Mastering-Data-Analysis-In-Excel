# Mastering-Data-Analysis-In-Excel
During my Master of Business Analytics degree program, I took Spreadsheet Modeling and Financial Modeling classes that covered manipulating data using Microsoft Excel above the intermediate level. However, to hone my skills, be better prepared for the job market and perhaps learn something new, I decided to take an Udemy course - Mastering Data Analysis in Excel by Vardges Zardaryan.

The course uses a delivery company dataset with 18,480 customers and 67,375 order records for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. In addition, a housing dataset with 200 records was used for regression analysis, and a web page testing dataset with 1000 records was used for A/B testing.

The following topics were covered during this course;

Data Cleaning and Preparation Tools

Most Frequently Used Functions - Logical, Math, Text, Date, Conditional, Statistical and Financial Functions

Pivot Table for Data Analysis

Scenario and Sensitivity Analysis - Goal Seek, Data Table, and Scenario Manager

Lookup Functions and Merging Techniques - VLOOKUP, INDEX and MATCH

Formatted and Interactive Tables

Charts and Visualization Techniques

Data Analysis ToolPak for Statistics

A/B Testing with Excel

Inserting Hyperlinks

Protecting the Worksheet
